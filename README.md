Spring Boot makes it easy to set up a simple OAuth2 backed application, using any common authentication resource, like Facebook, Google, or GitHub. By default, these ‘Users’ are ephemeral, and have an authority of ROLE_USER. Sometimes this is good enough for simple applications, but often we want to use our own User objects as the Principal in our application, and those Users often have further sets of Roles or Authorities of their own that our application uses for authorization.
